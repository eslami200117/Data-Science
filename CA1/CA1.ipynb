The code generates a specified number of random points within a square, and then checks if each point is within a circle with a radius equal to the half of the square's side. The ratio of points inside the circle is then multiplied by 4 to get an estimate of the value of `pi`. The main function generates random points, estimates `pi`, and prints the result.\n"
